# Collatz Problem

### Description

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
Also known as 3n+1 problem.

## What is the problem

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

- If the number is even, divide it by two.
- If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

Now form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next. 

**The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.**

## My research

I'm trying to see what are the probabilitys from the simulations about odd numbers and even numbers, too see if i find any constant and a few more things. For that i wrote 2 applications in phyton.

1. V-RandomNumber: 
Picks a random number Determine probability and information on the simulation on that number

2. V-Final: 
Will let u choose the number of simulations u wanna do, tha picks a random number for each simulation then will: 
- Get the probablity of every one of the simulations ( Report will print txt file "ReportProblem3x+1" ) 
- Determine the probablity of all simulation ( Information in txt "ProbabilityReportProblem3x+1" )

Will public applications soon. This probabilitys that return in the applications are about odd or even number in each simulation for a random number each time and few more ideias.
