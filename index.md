## CTFs

What is a CTF?
A CTF stands for Capture the Flag, a game in which players put their skills to practice to solve problems or break into an opponent’s system. 
Below are different types of CTFs:

    - Jeopardy style: In this variant, players solve certain problems to acquire “flags”(a specific string of text) to win.
    - Attack-Defence: In this type, two teams are created- Red Team (which tries to breach the system) and Blue Team (which tries to defend the system).
